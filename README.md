Due to the inability to save the settings of the ACE IDE implemented in cPanel, I was forced to inject CSS to at least change the appearance of the cloud IDE. Yes, there are currently much better and more advanced IDEs, but for what we are already used to doing quick edits on shared hostings, it doesn't hurt.
