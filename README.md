  Due to the inability to save the ACE IDE settings implemented in cPanel when <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> is pressed, I was forced to inject CSS to at least change the appearance of the cloud IDE. Yes, I know about much better and more advanced IDEs out there, but for those of us who are already used to making quick edits through cpanel, it doesn't hurt.

  Any browser CSS injector extension should do the trick.
  Tested on Google Chrome & MS Edge using [ABC JS-CSS Injector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/abc-js-css-injector/dnoagfebjndkhkabjkkoeeijnjpmbimj)
